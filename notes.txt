1. What is React Router DOM?
React Router DOM is a library used for routing in React applications. It allows navigation between different components without reloading the page.

2. Installation
To install React Router DOM, use:

npm install react-router-dom

3. createBrowserRouter
âœ… Function to create routes in React.

Syntax:

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <Home />
  },
  {
    path: "/about",
    element: <About />
  }
]);
ðŸ”¥ What Does It Do?
It defines the path and which component (element) should render on that path.
It works with Browser History API to prevent page reloads.

4. RouterProvider
âœ… Special component that provides the router instance to your entire app.

Syntax:
<RouterProvider router={appRouter} />

What Happens Here?
The router prop is passed.
It renders the correct component based on the current URL.
Without RouterProvider, routing won't work.

5. Link Component
âœ… The Link component is used to navigate between pages without refreshing the page.

Syntax:
<Link to="/about">About</Link>

How Is It Different from <a> Tag?

<a> Tag	Link Component            <Link>
Refreshes the page	              Does not refresh
Default HTML tag	              React Component
Breaks Single Page App	          Maintains Single Page App
